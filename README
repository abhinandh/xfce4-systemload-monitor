System Load plugin for XFce4.

This plugin displays the current system load on
the XFce4 panel.

I should work on most *NIX systems but
I've tested it only on linux.

Please if you manage to run in on non linux systems,
drop me a line at <frivoal@xfce.org>.

Added ability to configure update interval.
Can now display uptime in a single line.
